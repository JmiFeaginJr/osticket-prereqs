<p>
Upon provisioning a resource group within the Microsoft Azure environment, a virtual network is established as an integral component. Subsequently, the creation of a virtual machine ensues, facilitating remote desktop access as per our operational requirements.

 To gain access to Remote Desktop for our virtual machine hosted within Azure, it is essential to acquire the public IP address assigned to the virtual machine. This public IP address serves as the endpoint through which remote connections are established.

<p>
Upon obtaining the public IP address, it can be seamlessly integrated with the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), facilitating the initiation of remote desktop sessions. Subsequently, users can utilize their designated credentials, previously established during the virtual machine's configuration, to securely log in and access the system remotely.
